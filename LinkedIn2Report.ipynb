        "This Colab notebook is designed to analyze LinkedIn profiles by fetching user details and posts via LinkedIn's API. It then performs a detailed analysis using a custom AI model hosted by OpenRouter.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this notebook is to provide insights into the professional background, engagement levels, and areas of expertise of LinkedIn users, which can be particularly useful for creatives, professionals, marketers, or personal branding experts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The notebook retrieves user details and their latest posts from LinkedIn.\n",
        "2. It constructs a comprehensive prompt with these details and asks an AI model to analyze the content.\n",
        "3. The AI model evaluates the posts to provide insights on professional interests, skills, trends in discussion topics, and recommendations for professional growth.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Setup Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Replace `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual OpenRouter API key.\n",
        "2. Replace Rapid API key placeholders with your actual LinkedIn API keys.\n",
        "3. Enter the URL of the LinkedIn profile you wish to analyze when prompted.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Precautions\n",
        "\n",
        "- Be mindful of API usage limits and potential costs associated with high usage.\n",
